            <strong>Publication of Department of Defense Instruction 3000.17 “Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response”</strong>
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            The Department of Defense published the Department of Defense Instruction 3000.17 “Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response” on Dec. 21, 2023. 
            This instruction requires that combatant commands publish reports at least quarterly on the command’s unclassified, publicly accessible website 
            that provide information on the status and results of reviews, assessments, and investigations relating to civilian harm. U.S. Central Command 
            reviews and assesses all information related to civilian harm and publishes quarterly reports in accordance with this guidance.

            <strong>Discrepancies between U.S. Central Command civilian harm assessments and NGO Reports</strong>
          </Typography>
          <Typography paragraph>
            U.S. Central Command civilian harm assessment reports occasionally differ from other organizations’ reports, including non-governmental organizations, 
            for a number of reasons. The command’s reviews rely on a variety of sources, including open-source information and information from reliable and 
            multi-layered intelligence sources, as well as classified operational reporting, some of which is not accessible to the public. This can contribute 
            to perceived discrepancies between the command’s assessments and those of others.
